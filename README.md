# Lab-2

## Narrative  
### Topic and parameters used for search:  
The topics I chose for this project are three environmental protests: Standing Rock, Fairy Creek, and the Clayoquot Protest. I conducted three separate YouTube web scrapes, one for each topic. 
For each scrape, I used the protest name as the main search term (for example, “Standing+Rock” or “Fairy+Creek”). I collected text data from video titles and descriptions. The same general search approach was used for all three topics so that the results could be compared fairly.  

### Why this comparison?  
I wanted to compare these three protests because they are all environmental movements connected to Indigenous land and resource protection, but they happened in different places and at different times. I also have some personal attachments to the Fariy Creek protests as they happened around my hometown and on the island where I grew up, so this theme felt particularily important to me.  

### Comparing the word clouds:  
The word clouds for the three topics showed clear differences in themes. The Standing Rock word cloud contained more words related to Indigenous rights and environmental protection reflecting the strong connection between the protest, Native sovereignty, and water protection.  
The Fairy Creek word cloud showed more emphasis on people turning out to protests as well as themes related to logging, environmental concerns, and the British Columbia government suggesting that the discourse around Fairy Creek is more focused on public participation, government response, and forest protection.  
The Clayoquot Protest took place in 1993, so the word cloud results were not as specific as I expected. Instead of focusing mainly on the original protest, many words were related to current day US political issues, including ICE protests and the current administration.   

### Possible reasons for the patterns observed:  
One possible reason for these patterns is the timing and visibility of each protest. Standing Rock received a lot of national and international attention, especially around Indigenous rights and environmental protection, which explains why those themes appear strongly in the word cloud.  
Fairy Creek is a more recent and ongoing issue in British Columbia, so YouTube content focuses more on current events. People were also actively documenting the protests, so themes appear more clearly and consistently.  
The Clayoquot Protest happened in 1993, before social media was really around, so many of the YouTube results dont seem to entirly reference the Clayoquot protest and instead appear to mix the historical protest with current political topics, especially U.S. political issues. This makes the word cloud less specific to the original event. 

### How I would improve my research:  
I could improve my research by refining the search terms to better separate historical content from modern political discussions. For example, adding dates or more specific keywords related to the 1993 Clayoquot Protest might help reduce the unrelated results. So, perhaps instead of using the key words "qlayoquot+protest" I would remove "protest" and put "1993": "qlayoquot+1993".

### What was different from my expectations before the exercise and what stood out to me:  
One unexpected result was how clear and focused the Standing Rock and Fairy Creek word clouds were compared to Clayoquot. I expected the Clayoquot results to focus more directly on logging and environmental activism in British Columbia. I really was not expecting to get so many results around current day politics, especially ICE related.
